Welcome to my new blog! This site is built with Hugo and uses the beautiful FixIt theme (a maintained fork of LoveIt).

## Features

- Clean, modern design
- Dark/light mode support
- Fast loading times
- Mobile responsive
- Easy content management with Decap CMS

I can write new posts through the admin interface at `/admin` or edit files directly in markdown.
